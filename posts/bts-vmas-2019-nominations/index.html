Koreans have their own unique way of looking at movies, which can be seen in the way they make and consume movies. This unique perspective has led to some defining features of Korean cinema that are often difficult for other cultures to understand. One such feature is the reliance on audience Participation. In Korean films, audiences are typically allowed to choose what happens next in order to ensure their own level of involvement in the story. This allows for a more personal experience for viewers, who can often identify with the characters and their struggles. Another defining feature of Korean cinema is its focus on artistry over realism. While other films may use realistic techniques to create an emotional impact, Korean films usually rely on surrealism and abstraction to tell their stories effectively.\n","wordCount":"1014","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-05-05T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-05-05T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dr. Ara Monahan Sr."},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://kpopbuzz.github.io/posts/bts-vmas-2019-nominations/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Kpopbuzz","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://kpopbuzz.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://kpopbuzz.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://kpopbuzz.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://kpopbuzz.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://kpopbuzz.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://kpopbuzz.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://kpopbuzz.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Bts Vmas 2019 Nominations ~ [กระทู้ข่าว][20aug19][blackpink]สาวๆ Blackpink เข้าชิงสาขาnew Best</h1><div class=post-description>Vmas 1984 kill awards did vs modern 90s bands boy</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-05-05 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>May 5, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1014 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Dr. Ara Monahan Sr.</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#mtv-vmas-news-rumours-and-updates>MTV VMAs News Rumours And Updates</a></li><li><a href=#bts-receives-4-nominations-for-mtvs-2019-video-music-awards-vmas>BTS Receives 4 Nominations For MTV’s “2019 Video Music Awards” (VMAs</a></li><li><a href=#did-modern-media-kill-the-vmas-a-look-back-at-the-1984-vs-2019-video>Did Modern Media Kill The VMAs?

There is no one definition of Korean film. Koreans have their own unique way of looking at movies, which can be seen in the way they make and consume movies. This unique perspective has led to some defining features of Korean cinema that are often difficult for other cultures to understand.
One such feature is the reliance on audience Participation. In Korean films, audiences are typically allowed to choose what happens next in order to ensure their own level of involvement in the story. This allows for a more personal experience for viewers, who can often identify with the characters and their struggles.</li></ol><p>Another defining feature of Korean cinema is its focus on artistry over realism. While other films may use realistic techniques to create an emotional impact, Korean films usually rely on surrealism and abstraction to tell their stories effectively.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://kpopbuzz.github.io/tags/k-pop/>K-pop</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://kpopbuzz.github.io/posts/bts-face-meme/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Bts Face Meme : We Embarassin 😶😶</span></a>
