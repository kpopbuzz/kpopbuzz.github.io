In Korean cinema, there are three basic types of films: historical dramas, poetic/mythical dramas, and comedies. There are also a variety of other subgenres such as horror, action, and family-friendly films.
Historical dramas often tell the stories of Korea&rsquo;s history from the perspective of the people who lived through it. These films can be seen as a flashback to Korea&rsquo;s past or as a recounting of events from the present day.</p><p>Poetic/mythical dramas often focus on themes that are outside the scope of traditional academic research. They can be seen as pieces of poetry or mythology that have been interpreted by artists or writers.</p><p>Comedy films are often lighthearted and comedic in nature, but they can also deal with serious issues such as poverty and corruption.</p><h2 id=jung-ji-ahn-정지안--mydramalist>Jung Ji Ahn (정지안)- MyDramaList<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#jung-ji-ahn-정지안--mydramalist>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.mydramalist.com/4EEy1_5_c.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KelfYHZYLyWpOQiNnNtDywHaI4&pid=15.1"' alt="Jung Ji Ahn (정지안)- MyDramaList"><p><em>Source: pt.mydramalist.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Breakdown of songs used in Kpop shows
