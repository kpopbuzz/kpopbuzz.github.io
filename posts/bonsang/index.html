Fans of K-pop idols and performers have a lot to worry about when it comes to what goes on in the industry behind the scenes. Whether it&rsquo;s rumors of bad blood between groups, or ability to pick up information from people who are not associated with the music industry, fans can be very worried. However, it seems that much of this gossip is just hearsay - and there is no harm in that. In fact, some performers and fans even believe that it helps keep their relationship healthy and open. So while gossip may be harmful to some individuals, as a fan who loves what they do, it can be a valuable commodity in getting new information about their artists and groups.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://kpopbuzz.github.io/tags/k-pop/>K-pop</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://kpopbuzz.github.io/posts/jung-suk-won/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Jung Suk Won - ‎the President&amp;#039;s Last Bang (2005) Directed By Im Sang-soo • Reviews</span></a>
