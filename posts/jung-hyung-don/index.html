Looking back on the history of popular music in South Korea, it is hard to not notice how a certain genre of music has developed over time. K-Pop, or popular music, began as a very simple form of rock and roll in South Korea in the early 1960s. The genre quickly grew to become one of the most popular in the country, with artists like Psy and Kim Jong-un being some of the most well-known faces in the industry. What started as a simple form of rock and roll has now become one of South Korea&rsquo;s most successful exports, and has even seen minor crossover into other countries around the world.</p><h2 id=scans-ss501-kim-hyun-joong--japan-magazine-arena-37-august-2008>Scans] SS501 Kim Hyun Joong @ Japan Magazine “Arena 37℃” August 2008<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#scans-ss501-kim-hyun-joong--japan-magazine-arena-37-august-2008>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4t58IvSZlXg/TDlMCOrxSJI/AAAAAAAAAhw/6rXqNuIoJps/s1600/HJ_arenaaug010.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.eg6wHmvk6lX9ddfJA1VeNgHaMC&pid=15.1"' alt="Scans] SS501 Kim Hyun Joong @ Japan magazine “Arena 37℃” August 2008"><p><em>Source: ss501galore.blogspot.com</em></p><blockquote><p>joong hyun ss501 kim scans japan arena issues 2008 august magazine july 2009.</p></blockquote><p>What are K-Pop photos?
