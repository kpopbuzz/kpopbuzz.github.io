Koreans have their own unique way of looking at movies, which can be seen in the way they make and consume movies. This unique perspective has led to some defining features of Korean cinema that are often difficult for other cultures to understand. One such feature is the reliance on audience Participation. In Korean films, audiences are typically allowed to choose what happens next in order to ensure their own level of involvement in the story. This allows for a more personal experience for viewers, who can often identify with the characters and their struggles.
