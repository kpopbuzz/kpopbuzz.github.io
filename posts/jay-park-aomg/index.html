The Kpop industry is on the rise and there is no denying that it has a bright future. Whether it be due to the popularity of K-Pop, the craze for new and innovative music, or simply the ever-growing demand for talent, there is no doubt that Kpop will continue to dominate both in terms of visibility and influence.
With so much potential ahead of it, one would think that Korea&rsquo;s music industry would have been able to keep up with global trends by now. However, according to some recent reports, this may not be the case at all. Some Koreans are questioning whether or not K-Pop is truly mature enough to handle such high standards and expanding horizons; while others are hopeful that the industry can continue growing even beyond 2016.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://kpopbuzz.github.io/tags/k-pop/>K-pop</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://kpopbuzz.github.io/posts/hyorin-crab-dance/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Hyorin Crab Dance ~ Hyorin Sistar Kesal Sengaja Difoto Dalam Pose Jelek</span></a>
