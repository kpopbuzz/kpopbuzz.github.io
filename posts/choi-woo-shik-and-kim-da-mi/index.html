A k-pop video is a short movie or television program that is made by and for Korean pop artists. K-pop videos typically have around two minutes of runtime, which makes them shorter than most other genres of television programming. Because of this, they are often seen as an important part of k-pop culture and are often used to promote new music, tours, and other events.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://kpopbuzz.github.io/tags/k-pop/>K-pop</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://kpopbuzz.github.io/posts/bts-teat/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Bts Teat ~ A White Day 하얀날 🍬 On Twitter: &amp;quot;190419 뮤직뱅크 출근 귀여워🍃🍃🍃💖 #흰달 #suga #슈가</span></a>
