K-Pop is a genre of music and dance that emerged in South Korea in the early 1990s. The term &ldquo;K-Pop&rdquo; is derived from the word &ldquo;karaoke,&rdquo; which means singing in a high voice. K-Pop has since become one of the most popular genres in the world, with over 200 million copies sold worldwide.
Today, there are several different types of K-Pop music, including pop, rock, and hip hop. Each style has its own unique sound and style. Some popular K- Pop stars include Psy, Lee Minho, JYP Entertainment&rsquo;s Kim Jong Il, Sonex(Gangnam Style), CLAPPER(Clipse), and Yoo Jae Suk.</p><p>Despite its popularity, there are some questions that remain about K-Pop photos.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://kpopbuzz.github.io/tags/k-pop/>K-pop</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://kpopbuzz.github.io/posts/chinese-sm/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Chinese Sm : Shopping Malls: Golden Resources Shopping Mall</span></a>
